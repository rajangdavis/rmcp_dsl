# Runtime dependencies. Keep these in step with rmcp_dsl.gemspec. The Gemfile deliberately does not say
# `gemspec`: that makes Bundler treat this directory as an installed gem, and Sorbet then caches its
# rbi/ folder by name and version under ~/.cache/sorbet/gem-rbis. Hook runs from temporary copies of
# the project poisoned that cache with paths that no longer exist, and `srb tc` failed.
# Prism's node classes change between versions, so Gemfile.lock is committed: it is the exact pin.
